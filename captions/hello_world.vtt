00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.230 align:middle line:90%


00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:03.300 align:middle line:84%
Let's create our first
Fortran programme.

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.130 align:middle line:90%
It will be a very simple one.

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.930 align:middle line:84%
It will just print,
hello_world to standard output

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:09.675 align:middle line:84%
so that it shows
up in the terminal.

00:00:09.675 --> 00:00:12.160 align:middle line:84%
A Fortran programme
is just a text file.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.820 align:middle line:84%
So you can use any
text editor you like.

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to use
vim because that's

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.030 align:middle line:90%
the one I'm most familiar with.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.510 align:middle line:90%


00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.370 align:middle line:84%
So the name of the file is
going to be hello_world.f90.

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:34.890 align:middle line:90%


00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.890 align:middle line:84%
Don't worry, I'm not going
to type all the time.

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.190 align:middle line:90%
I'm just doing this once.

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.450 align:middle line:84%
So each Fortran application
has one and only

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.030 align:middle line:90%
one compilation unit program.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.630 align:middle line:90%
So that's what we start with.

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:56.360 align:middle line:84%
The name of that compilation
unit is hello_world.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.710 align:middle line:84%
It need not be identical
to the file name.

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.780 align:middle line:84%
But of course, it's a
bit neater if it is.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.300 align:middle line:84%
So we end that compilation
unit with end programm

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.780 align:middle line:84%
And just for good measure, we
add the name of the compilation

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.754 align:middle line:90%
unit, so hello_world.

00:01:13.754 --> 00:01:16.790 align:middle line:90%


00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.070 align:middle line:84%
Now we add a single
print statement.

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.890 align:middle line:90%


00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.090 align:middle line:84%
First, we have to specify
some formatting information.

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to use the
default, which is an asterisk.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.980 align:middle line:84%
No worries, we will
come back to that later.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.410 align:middle line:84%
And then the string
which we want to print.

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.485 align:middle line:84%
In this case, just
'hello world'.

00:01:37.485 --> 00:01:40.950 align:middle line:90%


00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.650 align:middle line:84%
And I'm using single quotes
to delimit the string.

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.360 align:middle line:90%
I could use double quotes.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.340 align:middle line:84%
You can do whatever
you like both work.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.110 align:middle line:90%
It's up to you.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to save the
file and quit the editor.

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.660 align:middle line:84%
And now I can compile
the code and link it

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.100 align:middle line:90%
into an application.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to use a
gfortran compiler.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.447 align:middle line:84%
The name of the executable is
going to be hello_world.exe.

00:02:06.447 --> 00:02:09.789 align:middle line:90%


00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.850 align:middle line:84%
And the name of the file
which I want to compile is

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.980 align:middle line:90%
hello_world.f90.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.930 align:middle line:90%
We can execute that.

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.780 align:middle line:84%
And you see that hello
world is printed.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.840 align:middle line:84%
We can improve the source code a
little bit by making the string

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.030 align:middle line:90%
into a variable.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:35.160 align:middle line:84%
Because actually, it will
be the same every time.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.844 align:middle line:84%
So that would be a
variable of type character.

00:02:38.844 --> 00:02:41.570 align:middle line:90%


00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.000 align:middle line:84%
And we have to specify
a length for that.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.580 align:middle line:84%
That length should be
at least the number

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.320 align:middle line:90%
of characters in the string.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.310 align:middle line:90%
But it can be more.

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.720 align:middle line:84%
So just to be on the
safe side, let's say 20.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.650 align:middle line:90%
That should do fine.

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:01.650 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, we
have a variable message

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.240 align:middle line:90%
which we assign our string to.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.760 align:middle line:84%
And now we can simply
use the variable,

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.790 align:middle line:84%
which we just defined, in
order to use the value.

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.380 align:middle line:90%
Nothing special here.

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:17.330 align:middle line:90%
So we save this.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.120 align:middle line:90%


00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.290 align:middle line:90%
And we compile it again.

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:31.470 align:middle line:84%
So gfortran -o hello_world.exe
hello_world.f90.

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.290 align:middle line:90%


00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:37.850 align:middle line:90%
That went fine.

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.920 align:middle line:90%
We run the application.

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.790 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we get the
expected result. Or not.

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.580 align:middle line:90%
This is odd.

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.050 align:middle line:90%
So something went wrong.

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.500 align:middle line:84%
Probably, you already
saw what the problem is.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.190 align:middle line:84%
But let's solve it in
a more structured way.

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.330 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things which is
very good practise in Fortran

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.230 align:middle line:84%
is to declare explicitly
that all variables

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.960 align:middle line:84%
in your programme, in
your computation unit,

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.400 align:middle line:90%
need to be declared.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.520 align:middle line:84%
And that can be done by
starting the compilation

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.780 align:middle line:90%
unit with implicit none.

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.269 align:middle line:90%


00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:20.600 align:middle line:90%
We save the file.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:21.920 align:middle line:90%
And we compile it again.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:27.110 align:middle line:90%


00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.720 align:middle line:84%
And then you see that we
get a compilation error.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.510 align:middle line:84%
And actually learning to
interpret compilation errors

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:36.300 align:middle line:84%
is an important part of learning
a new programming language.

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:43.040 align:middle line:84%
So the error says, symbol
massage at the location

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.500 align:middle line:90%
has no implicit type.

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.330 align:middle line:90%
And it even goes a bit further.

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.540 align:middle line:84%
Compiler says, OK, did
you actually mean message?

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.340 align:middle line:90%
And indeed, that was the plan.

00:04:53.340 --> 00:05:00.120 align:middle line:84%
So let's go back to the editor
and actually fix our problem.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.230 align:middle line:90%
And save the file again.

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:08.120 align:middle line:84%
And when we compile,
now everything is fine.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.930 align:middle line:84%
When we run, we get
the expected result.

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.980 align:middle line:84%
So we've just created our very
first Fortran application.

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:19.090 align:middle line:84%
Time to move on to
more interesting stuff.
