00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:02.850 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to the last
week of Fortran

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.620 align:middle line:90%
for scientific computing.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.500 align:middle line:84%
This week, we'll discuss
libraries, libraries

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.230 align:middle line:84%
for linear algebra,
like BLAS and LAPACK,

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.480 align:middle line:84%
and how you can call them
from your Fortran code.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.630 align:middle line:84%
We'll also talk about
interoperability

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.220 align:middle line:84%
with other
programming languages,

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.700 align:middle line:90%
such as C and Python.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.920 align:middle line:84%
Furthermore, we'll
discuss a format

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.850 align:middle line:84%
for scientific data
storage, which is HDF5--

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:28.470 align:middle line:90%
quite useful.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.470 align:middle line:84%
And lastly, we'll discuss
parallel programming,

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.330 align:middle line:84%
not in depth, but
just to give you

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:38.820 align:middle line:84%
an idea of the options that are
available to you in Fortran.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.540 align:middle line:84%
So I hope you will
enjoy this last week.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.570 align:middle line:90%
And let's get started.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:45.070 align:middle line:90%
