00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:03.170 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to this
course on Fortran

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:05.150 align:middle line:90%
for scientific computing.

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.652 align:middle line:84%
So why would you want to learn
Fortran in the first place?

00:00:09.652 --> 00:00:11.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's a language
that's specifically

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.550 align:middle line:84%
designed with scientific
computing in mind.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:18.500 align:middle line:84%
So it's easy to develop
scientific applications.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.160 align:middle line:84%
Also, it will give you a very
decent performance just out

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.990 align:middle line:90%
of the box.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.150 align:middle line:84%
Those are compelling
reasons to use Fortran

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.200 align:middle line:84%
as a programming language
for scientific computing.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.330 align:middle line:84%
It's actually a
pretty old language.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.760 align:middle line:84%
But it has evolved
over the decades

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.940 align:middle line:84%
and embraced new ideas
and new paradigms.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.030 align:middle line:84%
And we will be discussing
the latest Fortran standard,

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.110 align:middle line:90%
which is Fortran 2018.

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.990 align:middle line:84%
In week one, you'll learn how
to set up your own development

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.860 align:middle line:90%
environment.

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.730 align:middle line:84%
And you will also be covering
the basics of the Fortran

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.920 align:middle line:90%
programming language.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.980 align:middle line:84%
In week two, we will
go more in-depth

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:04.560 align:middle line:84%
into the concepts of Fortran
and learn more about those.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.720 align:middle line:84%
Week three will
concentrate mostly

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.510 align:middle line:84%
on object-oriented
programming with Fortran.

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.930 align:middle line:84%
While week 4 is
concerned with software

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.830 align:middle line:84%
engineering issues, but
mostly, with performance,

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.510 align:middle line:84%
which is, of course,
very important

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.360 align:middle line:90%
in scientific computing.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.800 align:middle line:84%
In week five will be
covering scientific libraries.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.745 align:middle line:84%
So basically, it's no good
to reinvent the wheel.

00:01:28.745 --> 00:01:30.120 align:middle line:84%
So you should be
aware that there

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.090 align:middle line:84%
are many scientific libraries
available in the Fortran

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.740 align:middle line:90%
ecosystem.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.840 align:middle line:84%
We'll also discuss
parallel programming

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.180 align:middle line:84%
a little bit, not
in depth, but just

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.670 align:middle line:84%
to give you an idea of
what's possible with Fortran.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.360 align:middle line:84%
Each week, there are
capstone exercises.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.900 align:middle line:84%
And those are, in fact,
the most important thing,

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.710 align:middle line:84%
which you should do because
they're open exercises, which

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.810 align:middle line:84%
have been selected
to be somewhat

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.850 align:middle line:84%
challenging and
somewhat interesting

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.920 align:middle line:90%
from a scientific perspective.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.400 align:middle line:84%
And we hope that you
will enjoy those.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.210 align:middle line:84%
Those are the best learning
opportunities, actually.

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.639 align:middle line:90%
OK, so let's get started.

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:13.730 align:middle line:84%
We hope you will have some
fun and that definitely you

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.500 align:middle line:84%
learn something that's useful
for you in your career.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:18.000 align:middle line:90%
