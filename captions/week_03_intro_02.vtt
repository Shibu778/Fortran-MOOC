00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.390 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to week three of Fortran
for Scientific Computing.

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.110 align:middle line:84%
This week, we'll deal
with user-defined types

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.670 align:middle line:84%
and with interfaces, as well
as dynamic memory allocation.

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.940 align:middle line:84%
And those form the basis for
object-oriented programming

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.980 align:middle line:84%
in Fortran, and that's the
main topic of this week.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.500 align:middle line:90%
So, let's dive in.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.000 align:middle line:90%
