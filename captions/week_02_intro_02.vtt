00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:04.050 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to the second
week of Fortran

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:06.460 align:middle line:90%
for scientific programming.

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.770 align:middle line:84%
So the main new thing which
we learn about this week

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:12.990 align:middle line:84%
is in fact arrays
and of course it's

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.900 align:middle line:84%
a very important part
of scientific computing,

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.530 align:middle line:84%
since they're used to
represent vectors and matrices.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:24.450 align:middle line:84%
We will also go more in-depth
into various Fortran features

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.805 align:middle line:84%
which were introduced before,
but not in sufficient detail.

00:00:29.805 --> 00:00:31.680 align:middle line:84%
So at the end of this
week, you will actually

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.060 align:middle line:84%
have a pretty good
overview of Fortran

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:35.490 align:middle line:90%
as a programming language.

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.420 align:middle line:84%
A few things are missing,
but that's for weeks to come.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.160 align:middle line:84%
Don't forget the
capstone exercises

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.710 align:middle line:84%
because those are your
main learning opportunity.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.500 align:middle line:90%
Let's go for it.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.000 align:middle line:90%
