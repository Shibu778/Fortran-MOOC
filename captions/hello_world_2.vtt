00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.900 align:middle line:90%


00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:04.720 align:middle line:84%
Let's start with
something really simple,

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.090 align:middle line:84%
just a hello world
application to get you going.

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.910 align:middle line:84%
So that will print a string
to the screen, and that's it.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.810 align:middle line:90%


00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:18.110 align:middle line:84%
A Fortran programme
is just a text file.

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.270 align:middle line:84%
So you can use any editor
who want to create it.

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:24.970 align:middle line:84%
I'll be using vim because
that's my favourite,

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.950 align:middle line:90%
and I'm most familiar with it.

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:36.250 align:middle line:84%
So vim hello_world.f90 The
extension .f90 just tells

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.380 align:middle line:84%
the editor and the compiler
that you're doing Fortran.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:42.880 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.760 align:middle line:84%
So a Fortran programme always
starts with program followed

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:49.990 align:middle line:90%
by the name.

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:53.920 align:middle line:90%
Let's call it hello_world.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:00.220 align:middle line:84%
And at the end, there is an
end program and optionally

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.970 align:middle line:90%
hello_world.

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.960 align:middle line:84%
But it's good practise
to put it there.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.349 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:09.970 align:middle line:84%
So we want to print a
string to the screen.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.120 align:middle line:84%
And for that, we use
a print statement.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.940 align:middle line:84%
The first thing we need
to specify is the format.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.030 align:middle line:84%
But we're happy with the
default formatting, which

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.550 align:middle line:90%
is done by the Fortran runtime.

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:28.000 align:middle line:84%
And we can just put an asterisk
and then what we want to print

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.390 align:middle line:90%
and this basically is a string.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:37.030 align:middle line:84%
Strings in Fortran are
enclosed in single quotes

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.780 align:middle line:90%
or double quotes.

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:38.740 align:middle line:90%
You can choose.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.570 align:middle line:84%
Personally, I prefer
single quotes.

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.330 align:middle line:90%


00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.220 align:middle line:84%
So this is the string which
we want to put on the screen.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.090 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.950 align:middle line:90%
We're done.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.080 align:middle line:84%
We save the file, and we go
back to the command line.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.620 align:middle line:90%
And now we can compile our code.

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.340 align:middle line:84%
For this, we need a
compiler, because a compiler

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.830 align:middle line:84%
will convert our source
code into an executable.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.850 align:middle line:84%
Let's called the
executable hello_world.exe.

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.340 align:middle line:90%


00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.880 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we specify
the name of the source file

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.310 align:middle line:90%
which we want to compile.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.780 align:middle line:84%
So the -o simply specifies the
name of the executable which is

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.200 align:middle line:84%
created by the compiler
based on the source file,

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.440 align:middle line:90%
hello_world.f90.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.550 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.160 align:middle line:90%
It's done, and we can run it.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.610 align:middle line:84%
And as you can see,
we get the string

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.313 align:middle line:84%
which we wanted
printed to the screen.

00:02:43.313 --> 00:02:45.480 align:middle line:84%
So let's move back to the
editor and change the code

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.022 align:middle line:90%
a little bit.

00:02:46.022 --> 00:02:48.450 align:middle line:90%


00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.800 align:middle line:84%
What we want to do is to
introduce a variable that holds

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.680 align:middle line:84%
our message to make the
programme a little bit more

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.540 align:middle line:90%
general.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.950 align:middle line:84%
So we introduce a variable, and
the type of that is character.

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.560 align:middle line:90%


00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:09.140 align:middle line:84%
And that will hold string
data if we specify a length.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.810 align:middle line:84%
And the length can
be anything, but it

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.380 align:middle line:84%
should be sufficient to
hold our entire string.

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.940 align:middle line:84%
And let's just make that,
to be on the safe side, 20

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.490 align:middle line:90%
characters.

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:23.630 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.035 align:middle line:84%
Then we have a
double colon and then

00:03:27.035 --> 00:03:29.670 align:middle line:84%
the names of the
variable of that type,

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:30.910 align:middle line:90%
so in this case, message.

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.640 align:middle line:90%


00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.300 align:middle line:84%
And we can initialize
that to the string which

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.910 align:middle line:84%
you want to print,
so hello world

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.350 align:middle line:90%
or hello Fortran in this case.

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:46.750 align:middle line:90%


00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.490 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:52.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is
actually a constant,

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.520 align:middle line:84%
so we can make that explicit by
adding the parameter attribute.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:02.330 align:middle line:90%


00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:03.620 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.980 align:middle line:84%
Now we place our string
with the variable.

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.980 align:middle line:90%


00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.840 align:middle line:90%
And we're ready to compile.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.290 align:middle line:84%
So we save and we go
back to the command line.

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.440 align:middle line:90%


00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:20.519 align:middle line:90%
We compile the code.

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.950 align:middle line:90%


00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:24.970 align:middle line:90%
That works.

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:26.951 align:middle line:90%
And we run our application.

00:04:26.951 --> 00:04:30.320 align:middle line:90%


00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.440 align:middle line:84%
Not quite-- so rather
than hello Fortran,

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.500 align:middle line:90%
we actually get 124 whatever.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.730 align:middle line:84%
So something is
definitely wrong here.

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:43.530 align:middle line:90%
Let's move back to the editor.

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:47.990 align:middle line:84%
So the one thing which is good
practise is to add implicit

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.620 align:middle line:84%
none to the compilation
unit, such as the program.

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.110 align:middle line:90%
And let's do that first.

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.090 align:middle line:90%


00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:02.830 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is that if
you use implicit none,

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:09.340 align:middle line:84%
each and every variable which
you use in your programme must

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.720 align:middle line:90%
be declared explicitly.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.550 align:middle line:84%
So let's just save and see
what compiler tells us now.

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:21.880 align:middle line:90%


00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.670 align:middle line:84%
So when we compile the
code, you see that now we

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:26.480 align:middle line:90%
get an error message.

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:31.750 align:middle line:84%
And the error says symbol
massage at the indicated line

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:35.740 align:middle line:90%
is not explicitly declared.

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:39.790 align:middle line:90%
So it has no implicit type.

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:41.740 align:middle line:84%
And it's even
helpful, and it says,

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.140 align:middle line:90%
did you actually mean message?

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:44.920 align:middle line:90%
Yes, of course.

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.990 align:middle line:84%
That was what I
meant, and massage

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:51.620 align:middle line:84%
might have been subconscious
wishful thinking on my part.

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:56.110 align:middle line:84%
So let's move back to the editor
again and fix the problem which

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:57.340 align:middle line:90%
is, of course, easy enough.

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:08.020 align:middle line:90%


00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.380 align:middle line:84%
And compile and
run the code again.

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:17.390 align:middle line:84%
And now, of course, everything's
fine, and it works as expected.

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:19.570 align:middle line:84%
So when you learn a new
programming language,

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:21.250 align:middle line:84%
getting familiar with
the error messages

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:25.400 align:middle line:84%
the compiler generates
is a quite useful skill.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:29.020 align:middle line:84%
So we did something
quite simple here.

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:31.900 align:middle line:84%
And I promise that this
is about in the last video

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.150 align:middle line:84%
where you actually
see me typing.

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:38.160 align:middle line:84%
But now, let's move on to
some more exciting stuff.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:39.000 align:middle line:90%
