00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:05.230 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to week one of Fortran
for Scientific Computing.

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:07.810 align:middle line:84%
This week will help
you set up your system

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:10.570 align:middle line:84%
so that you have a
development environment

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:12.910 align:middle line:90%
appropriate for Fortran.

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.260 align:middle line:84%
There are options for all major
operating systems, Windows,

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.710 align:middle line:90%
macOS and Linux.

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.620 align:middle line:84%
Then we'll cover the
basics of Fortran,

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:26.600 align:middle line:84%
so that you are able to
write very simple programmes,

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.670 align:middle line:90%
nothing special.

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:31.190 align:middle line:84%
We will go more
in-depth in later weeks.

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:34.060 align:middle line:84%
It's important that you
do the capstone exercises,

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.670 align:middle line:84%
because those are the ones
which actually will teach you

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.420 align:middle line:90%
the most.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.500 align:middle line:84%
Alright, have fun
and let's start.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.000 align:middle line:90%
