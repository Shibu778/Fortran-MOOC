Welcome to week 4 of Fortran
for Scientific Computing.

00:00:04.865 --> 00:00:06.240 align:middle line:84%
This week we'll
talk a little bit

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.120 align:middle line:84%
about software
engineering aspects

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.760 align:middle line:90%
of scientific computing.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.360 align:middle line:84%
So best practises in coding,
writing documentation,

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.020 align:middle line:90%
that kind of thing.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.610 align:middle line:84%
But most importantly, we'll
talk about performance.

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.370 align:middle line:84%
What determines the
performance of an application?

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:24.760 align:middle line:90%
How do you measure it?

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.960 align:middle line:84%
And, how does your programming
style influence performance?

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.700 align:middle line:84%
How can you programme in such
a way that you get fast running

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.900 align:middle line:90%
code?

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.310 align:middle line:84%
This should be pretty
interesting for HPC people,

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.370 align:middle line:90%
so enjoy.
