## Week 1

* In Fortran, god is real, unless declared otherwise.
* [Fortran programming class](https://comic.browserling.com/tag/fortran-programming)
* A computer without Fortran is like a piece of chocolate cake without mustard.


## Week 2

* [1-based array indexing](https://9gag.com/gag/arG5o15)
* [Xkcd on go to statements](https://xkcd.com/292/)
* [Real programmers don't use PASCAL](https://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/susan/joke/quiche.htm), letter to the editor of Datamation, volume 29 number 7, pp. 263-265, July 1983.
* Programming Languages are Like Cars

  * Assembler: A formula I race car.  Very fast but difficult to drive and maintain.
  * FORTRAN II: A Model T Ford. Once it was the king of the road.
  * FORTRAN IV: A Model A Ford.
  * FORTRAN 77: a six-cylinder Ford Fairlane with standard transmission and no seat belts.
  * COBOL: A delivery van. It's bulky and ugly but it does the work.
  * BASIC: A second-hand Rambler with a rebuilt engine and patched upholstery. Your dad bought it for you to learn to drive. You'll ditch it as soon as you can afford a new one.
  * PL/I: A Cadillac convertible with automatic transmission, a two-tone paint job, white-wall tires, chrome exhaust pipes, and fuzzy dice hanging in the windshield.
  * C++: A black Firebird, the all macho car. Comes with optional seatbelt (lint) and optional fuzz buster (escape to assembler).
  * ALGOL 60: An Austin Mini. Boy that's a small car.
  * ALGOL 68: An Aston Martin. An impressive car but not just anyone can drive it.
  * Pascal: A Volkswagon Beetle. It's small but sturdy. Was once popular with intellectual types.
  * LISP: An electric car. It's simple but slow. Seat belts are not available.
  * PROLOG/LUCID: Prototype concept cars.
  * FORTH: A go-cart.
  * LOGO: A kiddie's replica of a Rolls Royce. Comes with a real engine and a working horn.
  * APL: A double-decker bus. It takes rows and columns of passengers to the same place all at the same time but it drives only in reverse and is instrumented in Greek.
  * Ada: An army-green Mercedes-Benz staff car. Power steering, power brakes, and automatic transmission are standard. No other colors or options are available. If it's good enough for generals, it's good enough for you.
  * Java: All-terrain very slow vehicle.

## Week 3

* Q: What does a Fortran77 programmer call a pointer? A: A dummy argument.
* [The Fortran purity test](https://www.netfunny.com/rhf/jokes/92q1/fortquiz.html)
* [Aliens on The Simpsons](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/75mpb0/the_aliens_on_the_simpsons_sure_know_whats_up/)


## Week 4

* [Fortran coding style for the modren programmer](https://groups.google.com/g/comp.lang.fortran/c/TIYj2uhhXbU) (Remember, this *is* the humor section!)
* [The evolution of programming languages](https://onionesquereality.wordpress.com/tag/humour/)
* (in 1980) Q: What will the scientific programming language of the year 2000 look like? A: Nobody knows, but its name will be FORTRAN.


## Week 5
*  Consistently separating words by spaces became a general custom about the tenth century A. D., and lasted until about 1957, when FORTRAN abandoned the practice. (Sun FORTRAN Reference Manual)
* “FORTRAN, the infantile disorder, by now nearly 20 years old, is hopelessly inadequate for whatever computer application you have in mind today: it is now too clumsy, too risky, and too expensive to use.”(Edsger W. Dijkstra, circa 1970, known for very strong opinions)
* When X3J3 debated whether the minimum trip count for a DO loop should be zero or one in Fortran 77, Loren Meissner suggested a minimum trip count of two—reasoning (tongue-in-cheek) that if it was less than two then there would be no reason for a loop!
* During the same FORTRAN standards committee meeting at which the name "FORTRAN 77" was chosen, a satirical technical proposal was incorporated into the official distribution bearing the title "Letter O Considered Harmful". This proposal purported to address the confusion that sometimes arises between the letter "O" and the numeral zero, by eliminating the letter from allowable variable names. However, the method proposed was to eliminate the letter from the character set entirely (thereby retaining 48 as the number of lexical characters, which the colon had increased to 49). This was considered beneficial in that it would promote structured programming, by making it impossible to use the notorious GO TO statement as before. (Troublesome FORMAT statements would also be eliminated.) It was noted that this "might invalidate some existing programs" but that most of these "probably were non-conforming, anyway".
* When assumed-length arrays were being added, there was a dispute as to the appropriate character to separate upper and lower bounds. In a comment examining these arguments, Dr. Walt Brainerd penned an article entitled "Astronomy vs. Gastroenterology" because some proponents had suggested using the star or asterisk ("`*`"), while others favored the colon ("`:`").
