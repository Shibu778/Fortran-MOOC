# Fortran weak and strong points

## Question 1

I will use Fortran because...
1. it has good integration for CUDA. [Although you could integrate CUDA and Fortran, it would not be a nice experience.]
1. it has a rich collection of mathematcal functions. [True, Fortran has many intrinsic procedures for mathematics.]
1. it is easy to represent and compute with vectors and matrices. [Indeed, multi-dimensional arrays are first-class citizens in Fortran.]
1. the demand for Fortran programmers is huge. [Well, not really, but in academics and specialized industry domains it is widely used.]


## Question 2

Fortran is often used to develop the following applications
1. computer games [Nah, if ou know of an example, let me know.]
1. computational fluid dynamics [Indeed, Fortran is well suited for this.]
1. embedded systems [Although not impossible in theory, Fortran is not really the best language for this.]
1. monte carlo simulations [Indeed, Fortran is well suited for this and other types of simulations.]
