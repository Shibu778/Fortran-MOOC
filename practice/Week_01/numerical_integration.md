# Numerical Integration

## Trapezoidal rule

Often, the need arises for integrating a function that has no explicit antiderivative or one which is difficult to obtain.

One commonly used technique is the Trapezoidal rule, which computes the integral using trapezoids, instead of rectangles.

The formula for calculating the definite integral of a function f using the trapezoidal rule is given as:
$$\int_a^b f(x) = \frac{h}{2}(f(x_0)+f(x_1))-\frac{h^3}{12}f^{''}(\varepsilon)$$

â€‹Notice that if the second derivative of f is zero the exact result is obtained; that is for polynomials of degree 1 or less.

## Exercise 1

Make a program that computes the definite integral using the trapezoidal rule disregarding the error term.

Using the program calculate the following integrals and compare with the exact value:

1) $$\int_0^2 x^2$$

2) $$\int_0^2 sin(x)$$
