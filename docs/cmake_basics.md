# The basics of CMake

Building software is a fairly tedious process, and you should take care that it
is done correctly and reproducible.  This is especially important for large code
bases, but even for small projects, it saves a lot of time and headache when you
do it right.

[CMake](https://cmake.org/) is a build tool that is cross-platform and versatile.
Here, you will get some basic information on CMake and how to use it to build
Fortran programs, but there is much more to learn.


## Single source file

CMake uses recipes to build software, i.e,. `CMakeLists.txt` files.  Suppose you
want to build the "hello Fortran" example code.  In the same directory as the
source file `hello_fortran.f90`, create a file `CMakeLists.txt` with the following
contents.

~~~~
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.0)

project(fortran_basics LANGUAGES Fortran)

set(CMAKE_Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY
    ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/modules)
file(MAKE_DIRECTORY ${CMAKE_Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY})

add_compile_options(-Wall -Wextra)

add_executable(hello_fortran.exe hello_fortran.f90)
~~~~

* Line 1 specifies the minimum version of CMake to use, 3.0 in this case.
* Line 3 specifies the name of the project `fortran_basics` and the programming
  languages for this projects `Fortran`.
* Line 5 to 7 make sure that the `*.mod` files that are generated by the compiler
  are stored in the build directory.
* Line 9 specifies some additional options for the compiler, in this case `-Wall`
  and `-Wextra` to generate additional warnings about suspicious code.
* Line 11 defines the actual build, it specifies to compile `hello_world.f90` into
  an executable named `hello_fortran.exe`.

When building software, CMake will create a lot of artefacts that pollute your source
directory, so it is good practice to do the build in a dedicated subdirectory.

~~~~bash
$ mkdir build; cd build
~~~~

Before you can do your first build, CMake has to generate a number of files and
directories based on the `CMakeLists.txt` file in your source directory.  This is
done with the `cmake` command.

~~~~bash
$ cmake ..
~~~~

The argument of the `cmake` command is a directory where the relevant `CMakeLists.txt`
file is located, in this case `..` the parent directory of the build directory.

Now you are ready to build the executable.

~~~~bash
$ make
~~~~

In case you get compilation or linking errors, correct them.  If the build process
succeeded without errors, you can run the executable.

~~~~bash
$ ./hello_fortran.exe
~~~~
