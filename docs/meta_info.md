# Fortran for scientific programming

Find out why you should consider Fortran to develop your next scientific
application.  Although it is one of the oldest programming languages in
existence, it has evolved over the decades and has all the features you
would expect from a modern programming language.  As opposed to many other
programming languages, it was specifically designed with scientific computing
in mind.



## Overview

Want to learn a nice programming language for scientific computing?

In this course, you'll discover that Fortran is an excellent choice for
projects in the domain of scientific computing.  You will see that you can
perform vector and matrix computations with very few lines of code, both
on real and complex values.

You will learn all about the data types defined in Fortran, as well as the
control statements that make up the language.  You will also learn about best
practices and good coding style.

You will also see that Fortran has features such as dynamic memory management
and pointers, which allows you to deal with large amounts of data efficiently,
but also to build sophisticated data structures.  

You will see that you can do object-oriented programming in Fortran, designing
your own classes to build modern applications. 

Performance is often critical in scientific computing, so you'll learn about
profiling, but also best practices and pitfalls specific to Fortran.

Fortran has an ecosystem of libraries for scientific computing and you will see
some of the most relevant examples.  You'll also see how Fortran can
inter-operate with C and Python.

Finally, you will get a taste of doing parallel programming using Fortran, both
for shared memory and distributed computing.


## Topics

* Fortran statements and data types.
* Writing high quality and efficient code.
* Object-oriented programming with Fortran
* Learn to identify performance issues.
* Using scientific libraries.
* Interoperability with other programming languages.


## What will you achieve

By the end of this course you will be able to...

* develop well-written Fortran applications and libraries;
* identify and remedy common performance bottlenecks;
* use common scientific libraries;
* make an informed choice about how to proceed to learn more about
  parallel programming.


## Who is this course for

This is an intermediate level course aimed at people with some programming
experience who want to work in the domain of scientific computing.


## Who will you learn with?

### Geert Jan Bex

Back in the 90s I studied artificial neural networks using techniques of
statistical physics to determine the capabilities and limitations of such
systems.  I enjoyed creating simulations and solving equations numerically.
After an interlude as a knowledge engineer at a company specialized in IP
management I returned to research, but not to physics.  I studied the
inference of grammars describing semi-structured data.  Currently, I'm
working as an HPC analyst/consultant at Hasselt University/KU Leuven
supporting researchers and giving training.

### Mag Selwa

During my physics studies I got interested in computational physics/astrophysics.
After several postdoctoral positions I joined the Vlaaams Supercomputer Centrum
(VSC) and I stay close to science by supporting our HPC users.
