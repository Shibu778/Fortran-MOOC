# Coins

Compute change for a given amount of money, given a set of coin denominations.  A greedy
a dynamic programming approach is implemented.


## What is it?

1. `greedy_coins_mod.f90`: module implementing the greedy money chaning algorithm.
1. `dyn_prog_coins_mod.f90`: module implementing the dynamic programming money chaning
   algorithm.
1. `change.f90`: main program showing results for greedy and dynamic programming
   algorithm.
1. `CMakeLists.txt`: CMake file to build the applications.
