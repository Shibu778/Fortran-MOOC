# Exponential distribution

This is an example of an algorithm that benefits from saving variables form one
call to the other using the `save` attribute.

## What is it?

1. `exp_distr.f90`: implementation of the algorithm to generate normally distributed
   random number from a uniform distribution.
1. `CMakeLists.txt`: CMake file to build the applications.
