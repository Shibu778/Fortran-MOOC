## What is it?

1. `julia_set`: computation of the Julia set, illustrates
   use of complex number in Fortran, using command line
   arguments, using modules, using allocatable arrays.
   Both a sequential and OpenMP implementation are given.
1. `gcd`: computation of the greatest common divisor,
   used as illustration of indentation, use of while loop.
1. `leapyear`: check whether a year is a leap year,
   illustrates nested conditional statements.
1. `calculator`: simple command line calculator that
   implements addition, substraction and multiplication
   of floating point values, illustrates `select case`.
1. `distances`: compute Euclidian distences between points.
   Illustrates simple functions and reading from standard
   input.
1. `clamp`: clamp real number on standard input to values
   given on the command line, illustrates subroutines.
1. `call_by_semantics`: illustration of call-by-reference versus
   call-by-value semantics.
1. `recursion`: examples of recursive procedures.
