# Source code

This directory contains source code for exercises and
code examples used in videos and reading material.


## What is it?

1. `julia_set`: computation of the Julia set, illustrates
   use of complex number in Fortran, using command line
   arguments, using modules, using allocatable arrays.
   Both a sequential and OpenMP implementation are given.
1. `gcd`: computation of the greatest common divisor,
   used as illustration of indentation, use of while loop.
1. `leapyear`: check whether a year is a leap year,
   illustrates nested conditional statements.
1. `calculator`: simple command line calculator that
   implements addition, substraction and multiplication
   of floating point values, illustrates `select case`.
1. `distances`: compute Euclidian distences between points.
   Illustrates simple functions and reading from standard
   input.
1. `clamp`: clamp real number on standard input to values
   given on the command line, illustrates subroutines.
1. `call_by_semantics`: illustration of call-by-reference versus
   call-by-value semantics.
1. `recursion`: examples of recursive procedures.
1. `optional`: examples of optional arguments in Fortran procedures.
1. `exp_distr`: example of a function that uses a `save` attribute for its
   local variables.
1. `iterations`: code to illustrate Fortran iteration statements.
1. `sierpinski`: implementation to compute the Sierpinki gasket.
1. `ball_throw`: illustrate `exit` and preprocessor macros.
1. `config_parser`: illustration of `exit` and `cycle`, as well as an
   infinite loop.
1. `sum_values`: illustrates the use of `exit` and `cycle` as well as
   alternative.
1. `type_info`: illustrates the properties of integer and real kinds.
1. `cellular_automata`: implemention of cellular automata.
1. `strings`: some illustrations of using strings in Fortran.
1. `box_counting`: implementation of box counting to determine the
   Minskowski dimension of a 2D fractal, illustrates documentation
   using doxygen and documentation generation with CMake.
