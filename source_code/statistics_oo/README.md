# Statistics object-oriented

Example code taken from the field of (simple) statistics to illustrate a number of
concepts in object-oriented programming.

## What is it?

1. `dtio`: illustration of user defined type I/O.
1. `type_bound_procedures`: illustration of bound procedures.
1. `overloading`: illustrates generic type bound procedures (a.k.a.,
   method overloading).
1. `inheritance`: illustration of inheritance.  Note there is a potential
   bug when the number of values stored is less than the number of values
   used to create the `median_stats_t` variable.
1. `select_class`: illustration of runtime polymorphism and `select class`.
1. `CMakeLists.txt`: CMake file to build the applications.
1. `data1.txt`, `data2.txt`: small data files for testing purposes.
