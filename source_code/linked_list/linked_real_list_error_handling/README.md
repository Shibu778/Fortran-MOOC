# Linked list of real numbers

This is an implementation of a single linked list containing real numbers.
Note that the implementation is very fragile on purpose.  Here, error
handling has been added.

## What is it?

1. `linked_real_list_mod.f90`: module defining a single linked list of
   real numbers.
1. `test_list.f90`: program to test the implementation.
