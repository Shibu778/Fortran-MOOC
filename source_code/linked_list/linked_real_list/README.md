# Linked list of real numbers

This is an implementation of a single linked list containing real numbers.
Note that the implementation is very fragile on purpose.  On the one hand
this makes the implmentation easier to understand, on the other hand it
provides the basis of an exercise to make the code robust by adding error
handling.

## What is it?

1. `linked_real_list_mod.f90`: module defining a single linked list of
   real numbers.
1. `test_list.f90`: program to test the implementation.
