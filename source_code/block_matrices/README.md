# Block matrices

illustration of using a forall statement to initialize a block matrix.
Note that the assumption is that the block size divides the matrix size
exactly.

## What is it?

1. `block_matrix.f90`: program that creates and prints a block matrix
   for given sizes of matrix and block.
1. `CMakeLists.txt`: CMake file to build the applications.
