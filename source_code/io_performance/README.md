# I/O performance

Some code to experiment with various I/O modes and how they impact performance.


## What is it?

1. `sequential`: code illustrating sequential I/O.
1. `streaming`: code illustrating streaming I/O.
1. `asynchronous`: code illustrating asynchronous streaming I/O.
1. `CMakeLists.txt`: CMake file to build the applications.
1. `plot_spiral.sh`: plot the formatted data.


## Note

The output generated by sequential unformatted I/O can not be handled correctly
by the plot script (i.e., by gnuplot).  The reason for this is that the record
format of unformatted sequential I/O is Fortran specific.  The script can deal
with unformatted output generated by streaming I/O.
