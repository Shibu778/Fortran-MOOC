# Sequential I/O performance

Some code to experiment with various I/O modes and how they impact performance.


## What is it?

1. `formatted_write.f90`: program to write the golden spiral to a file using
   formatted I/O.
1. `formatted_read.f90`: program to read the data generated by `formatted_write.f90`
   and compute the line inegral along the spiral.
1. `unformatted_write.f90`: program to write the golden spiral to a file using
   unformatted I/).
1. `unformatted_read.f90`: program to read the data generated by `unformatted_write.f90`
   and compute the line inegral along the spiral.
1. `convert.f90`: program that reads an unformatted data file and write the data
   formatted to standard output.
1. `compute_distance.f90`: program that performs the same computations as
   `formatted_read.f90` and `unformatted_read.f90` to compare time spent in computation
   with that taken by I/O.
1. `CMakeLists.txt`: CMake file to build the applications.
