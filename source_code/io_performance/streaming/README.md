# Streaming I/O

Some illustrations of using streaming I/O.  Since there are hardly use cases
for streaming formatted I/O, we will not deal with that here.


## What is it?

1. `unformatted_write.f90`: program that writes data using streaming unformatted
   I/O.
1. `CMakeLists.txt`: CMake file to build the applications.
