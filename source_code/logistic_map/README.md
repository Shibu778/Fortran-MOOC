# Logistic map

Computing the logistic map using an elemental function on two arrays.


## What is it?

1. `logistic_map.f90`: program to compute the logistic map.
1. `logistic_map_2.f90`: program to compute the logistic map using dynamic memory
   allocation and meshgrid.
1. `meshgrid_mod.f90`: module that implements MATLAB/numpy's meshgrid function.
1. `CMakeLists.txt`: CMake file to build the applications.
1. `plot_map.sh`: Bash script that uses gnuplot to visualize the data.
