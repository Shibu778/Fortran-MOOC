# Preprocessor

Most Fortran compilers can invoke a preprocessor to deal with includes and other
macros.


## Waht is it?

1. `error_reporting.F90`: very simple application that reports on the file and
   line number in an error message.  Note that the file extension is `.F90`, not
   `.f90` as usual.
1. `CMakeLists.txt`: CMake file to build the applications.
