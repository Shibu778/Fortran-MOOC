# Arrays

Several short Fortran programs to illustrate arrays.

## What is is?

1. `array_elements.f90`: illustrates how to use the value of and assign
   values to array elements by index.
1. `array_initialization.f90`: illustrates how to initialize arrays.
1. `array_arithmethic.f90`: illustrates scalar-array and array-array arithmetics.
1. `subarrays.f90`: illustrates index "slicing" of Fortran arrays.
1. `matrix.f90`: illustrates a 2D array.
1. `CMakeLists.txt`: CMake file to build the applications.
